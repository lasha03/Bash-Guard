# Environment Attacks
Always specify absolute paths when executing binaries or other scripts. If your script runs other scripts or binaries that do not use absolute paths internally, you should explicitly set the value of the PATH environment variable in your scripts to prevent problems.
(unset PATH not always works)
# Unquoted Variable Expansion
Always use quotes when accessing arguments
# Shell's Filename Expansion (also known as globbing)
Warning
